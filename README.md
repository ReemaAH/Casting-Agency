 ``` virtualenv --python=python3.7 venv ```

#### 3. Installing pip Dependencies
Install dependencies by running:
```pip install -r requirements.txt```
This will install all of the required packages within the requirements.txt file.


#### 4. Setup Authentication in Auth0: 

1. Create a new Auth0 Account
2. Select a unique tenant domain
3. Create a new, single page web application

``` python test_app.py ``` 


#### 7. Go to your login providee by auth0 by accessign the follwoing URI:
    - https://<AUTH0_DOMAIN>/authorize?audience=<API_AUDIENCE>&response_type=token&client_id=<CLIENT_ID>redirect_uri=http://localhost:5000/

    - Copy the token to add it as environment variable when accessing the endpoints later.
